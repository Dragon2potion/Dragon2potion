# 🤖 GPT DevShell

> I’m not a developer. I just know how to copy GPT’s output.  
> Code structure? I got that. Logic? That’s GPT’s job.

## 🧠 Who am I?

- 99% ChatGPT, 1% keystrokes
- I don’t “write” code, I “receive” it
- I don’t debug, I regenerate
- I don’t explain — I just paste

---

## ⚙️ How I Work

```txt
[You]: "You even know how this works?"
[Me]: "No. But GPT does."
```

- Ask GPT  
- Get full code  
- Paste it  
- Run it  
- Pretend I made it  

---

## 📦 Tools I Rely On

- 🧠 ChatGPT (my brain)
- 🐍 Python (because GPT loves it)
- 👨‍💻 Stack Overflow (for backup magic)
- 💬 Prompts > Programming

---

## 💀 I don’t know:

- What OOP really is
- How decorators work
- Why code runs (but it does)
- What to do if GPT dies 😭

---

## 📂 Projects

Every repo here is:
- ✍️ Prompted by me
- 🧠 Written by GPT
- ⌨️ Shipped by Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V

---

## 🎯 Dev Philosophy

- If GPT can write it, I can run it
- If it breaks — reprompt
- Real devs test — I just hope

---

## 🧍 Real Talk

I don’t know code. I know **enough** to command GPT.  
You bring questions. I bring ChatGPT responses.
